          <h3>Historical Background</h3>
          <p>The Sorsogon National Agricultural School, originally named Castilla, Agricultural High School was created by the virtue of the RA No. 6565, on September 30, 1972 but later renamed to its present name (Sorsogon National Agricultural School) by authority of the President of the Philippines on August 27, 1974 through the representation of the Board of Sorsogon.</p>

          <p>The school site per  PD No. 233 is located at Mayon, Castilla, Sorsogon, with an area of 250 hectare, as surveyed later. It provides an ideal agricultural site due to its     topography, suitability to agricultural projects, accessibility and possibility for expansion. In June 26, 1996, the Sorsogon State College represented by the President, Dr. Augusto R. Nieves heartedly donated a parcel of one(1) hectare land to the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) Sorsogon National Agricultural High School headed by the    Regional Director, Atty. Victoriano B. Tirol Jr.. In addition, in December 15, 1999, Mr. Gerry Prieto sold a lot of one (1) hectare land to Sorsogon National Agricultural School with an amount of P100, 000.00. A portion of this coconut land was transferred and registered   under Act 3444. It was then again year 2001, when Mr. Prieto generously donated 2.2   hectares to Sorsogon National Agricultural School in the name of the Vocational School  Administrator, Mr. Bueno O. Mendez. The land was officially transferred dated December 27, 2001 under ARP No. 96060180418. The total of 4.2 hectares land area of the school was utilized for school building and agribusiness project were these areas earned from   several donors and sellers.</p>

          <p>The school was recognized under the direct supervision of the Director of the   Bureau of Vocational Education (BVE) of the Department of Education and Culture (DEC) now DECS, through the superintendent of Sorsogon School of Arts and Trade (SSAT) of Sorsogon, Sorsogon. Its initial operation stated during the school year 1974-1975, with an enrolment of 74 first year students only, all males and manned by pioneer working staff of seven(7) headed by a principal (Mr. Mauricio J. Medialda) three (3)teachers and facilitative staff comprising the storekeeper, accounting clerk and farm aide. The first commencement exercises of the school under the secondary vocational agriculture curriculum took place in SY 1977-1978 under new Principal Engineer Dominador T. Martinez.</p>

          <p>The following school year 1978-1979, the school offered a two-year Technical course in Agriculture or Post-Secondary course, owing to its desire to cater to the needs of the students, the parents and the community. The enrolment at that time reached up to 700 plus both secondary and post-secondary combined, although operating only under a budget for secondary program and a workforce of 32, teaching and non-teaching staff.</p>

          <p>The desire of the administration to provide the youth of the entire province the     opportunities to develop their skills and prepare for a lifelong gainful occupation based on agriculture technology, was further strengthened when it opened a tie-up program with the Bicol  University through BUCA by way of entering into a Memorandum of Agreement whereby     BUCA extended its available resources to the SNAS in order to strengthen not only its      instructional capability but also its research and extension program. Under this agreement, SNAS has to develop and implement a curriculum that will satisfy the TPAE minimum     standard requirement for any degree program where the two-year SNAS curriculum would fit in   collaboration BUCA, Guinobatan, Albay and the SNAS students eventually will be        admitted to any degree program that BUCA is offering after two year of the implementation of the curriculum.</p>

          <p>This program was started in 1984 during the administration of Mr. Emilio A. Tamayo as officer in charge and continued by the same principal Engr. Dominador T. Martinez when the latter was reinstated to his office in 1987. </p>

          <p>As the institution grows, it normally expects to expand its services to the community but     ironically, the school started to experience crisis in the enrolment both in secondary and post-secondary primarily attracted to the factors related to the 1998 implementation of free secondary education program of the government, under the RA 6565, and the subsequent offering of the General High Schools in the different barangays around the vicinity of SNAS. This situation was further aggravated by the peace and order condition of the place moreover, the negative attitude long persist  among the youth towards agriculture or farming program, notwithstanding some negative aspects on the part of administration with respect to its     facilities and logistics problems.</p>

          <p>However, prevailing situation was timely abated when Mr. Rodolfo Maralit of Daraga, Albay donated a one (1) hectare lot at San Rafael, Castilla, Sorsogon in favor of DECS SNAS through the efforts of some community leaders and barangay officials who showed interest of opening a new high school in the said barangay. This paved the way for the establishment of the SNAS extension classes at San Rafael, Castilla, Sorsogon starting SY 1991-1997 to date.</p>

          <p>A new classroom building was constructed on the newly donated  school site after a year of occupation of the administration-built temporary classroom and a vacant public market     building for its initial classes held at the barangay Poblacion of San Rafael and continuously existed for seven years in service.</p>

          <p>Mr. Emilio A. Tamayo, then the Officer-in-charge made the institution grows and   behind SNAS elevation to TESDA administered school in Sorsogon. On March 22, 1997, a major development took place. </p>
